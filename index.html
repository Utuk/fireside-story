        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
        the GitHub password validation tool was causing havoc. 
        No matter how the coding team tried...github would not authenticate 
        the password. "Why doesn't github allow my password?" the team 
        member cried. Nonetheless, the team pressed on, through 404s and
    annoying git bash text editors. </p>
